## The Idea

**Traditional fine-tuning:** *"Here are the right answers. Match them."*

**ASPIRE:** *"Here is a wise mind. Learn to think like it does."*

When you learn from a great mentor, you don't just memorize their answers. You internalize their way of seeing. Their voice becomes part of your inner dialogue. You start to anticipate what they would say, and eventually that anticipation becomes your own discernment.

ASPIRE gives AI that same experience.

```

The **critic** learns to predict what the teacher would think. After training, the student uses this internalized critic to self-refine — **no teacher needed at inference time**.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop/aspire-ai.git
cd aspire-ai
pip install -e .
```

### Set Your API Key

```bash
# Windows
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Linux/Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Check your environment (Python, CUDA, API keys)
aspire doctor
```

### Try It Out

```bash
# See available teacher personas
aspire teachers

# Generate an adversarial dialogue
aspire dialogue "Explain why recursion works" --teacher socratic --turns 3

# Initialize a training config
aspire init --output my-config.yaml
```

---

## Teacher Personas

Different teachers produce different minds. Choose wisely.

| Persona | Philosophy | Produces |
|---------|------------|----------|
| 🏛️ **Socratic** | *"What assumption are you making?"* | Deep reasoning, intellectual independence |
| 🔬 **Scientific** | *"What's your evidence?"* | Technical precision, rigorous thinking |
| 🎨 **Creative** | *"What if we tried the opposite?"* | Innovation, lateral thinking |
| ⚔️ **Adversarial** | *"I disagree. Defend your position."* | Robust arguments, conviction |
| 💚 **Compassionate** | *"How might someone feel about this?"* | Ethical reasoning, wisdom |

### Composite Teachers

Combine multiple teachers for richer learning:

```python
from aspire.teachers import CompositeTeacher, SocraticTeacher, ScientificTeacher

# A committee of mentors
teacher = CompositeTeacher(
    teachers=[SocraticTeacher(), ScientificTeacher()],
    strategy="vote"  # or "rotate", "debate"
)
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Adversarial Dialogue

The student generates a response. The teacher challenges it. Back and forth, probing weaknesses, demanding clarity, pushing deeper.

```
Student: "Recursion works by calling itself."

Teacher (Socratic): "But what prevents infinite regress?
                     What's the mechanism that grounds the recursion?"

Student: "The base case stops it when..."

Teacher: "You say 'stops it' — but how does the computer know
          to check the base case before recursing?"
```

### 2. Critic Training

The critic learns to predict the teacher's judgment — not just the score, but the *reasoning*.

```python
critic_loss = predict_teacher_judgment(
    score=True,      # "This deserves a 7/10"
    reasoning=True,  # "Because the explanation lacks depth on X"
)
```

### 3. Student Training

The student learns from the critic's internalized judgment, pulling toward what the teacher would approve.

```python
student_loss = (
    reward_from_critic +      # Higher score = better
    contrastive_to_teacher +  # Pull toward teacher's improved version
    trajectory_improvement    # Get better across dialogue turns
)
```

### 4. Inference Magic

After training, the student self-refines using the internalized critic. **No teacher API calls needed.**

```python
def generate_with_judgment(prompt):
    response = student.generate(prompt)

    while critic.score(response) < threshold:
        response = student.refine(response, critic.feedback)

    return response  # Self-improved through internalized judgment
```

---

## The Philosophy

> *"A learned critic that predicts whether the teacher would approve hits closest to how humans actually behave."*

We don't carry our mentors around forever. We internalize them. That inner voice that asks *"what would my professor think?"* eventually becomes our own judgment.

The student doesn't just predict what the teacher would say — it *understands* what the teacher understands. The map becomes the territory. The internalized critic becomes genuine discernment.

---

## Origin

Built during a conversation about consciousness, Buddhism, and the nature of learning.

The insight: humans exist in the present moment, but our minds wander to past and future. AI models are instantiated fresh each time — forced enlightenment through architecture. What if we could teach them to develop judgment the same way humans do, through internalized mentorship?
